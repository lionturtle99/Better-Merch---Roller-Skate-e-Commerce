## Motivation

Since I started rollerskating back in 2017 I have met so many wonderful skaters that say the same thing: "roller skating needs a rebranding". Roller skating merchandize became very popular in the 1970s when it was associated with disco music and roller discos. Since then roller skating culture has changed but the merchandiz estayed the same. This is my humble attempt to bring a new style to roller skating merechandise.

## üìã Research & Planning Log

### Rollerskate E-Commerce Website Proposal

* _e-commerce website for local artists to sell their rollerskate art at a convenient single location_
* _Firebase for authenticationa and database_
* _React frontend_

##### MVP
* _Sleek and professional UI_
* _Users should be able to signup/in/out_

* _Add items to a shopping cart and securely purchase those items_

#### Stretch Goals
* _3D landing page using ThreeJS_
* _Use authentication and authorization for artists to add items_
* _Use Printful API to add customizable t-shirt functionality_
* _Use Printful or another API to design your own skates and then render that image into a 3D model using something like https://www.homely.ai/_
* _Interact with that 3D model of your roller skates in a 3D environment_

### Attendance Log
